## Case Study 1: AEO Optimization for Global Data Leader
#### Achieving Position 3 & AI Overview Feature in 2 Weeks

A well-known global leader in redistribution of pricing and reference data needed to establish thought leadership around economic analysis. They wanted to capture high-intent search traffic for users seeking guidance on economic evaluation methodologies, and then guide them towards their economic data consultancy offerings.

 # Strategy
## Phase 1: Technical SEO Foundation

Before developing new content, I carried out a sweeping technical SEO audit that brought forward a few critical issues that would undermine (and already were undermining) the client's search performance. These needed quick resolution to make sure any new content strategy would be successful.

The main issues were with crawl efficiency and visibility of important pages. To fix this, I:

- Identified and removed parameter-based duplicate URLs from crawl paths using robots.txt directives and canonical tag implementation
- Remapped the site's internal linking structure to ensure all key content remained within three clicks of the homepage for optimal crawl depth
- Audited page rendering using Google's Mobile-Friendly Test and URL Inspection API, then advised the client's web manager to defer non-essential scripts to significantly improve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) scores identified through PageSpeed Insights
- Pruned non-indexable and redirecting URLs from content and tag subfolders, then split the sitemap into logical content types (service pages, posts) for enhanced monitoring and crawl efficiency

## Phase 2: Content Strategy & AEO Optimization

With technical foundation secured, I started to identify a cluster of high-intent keywords to target blog conrent around. Economic data consultancy is an extremely high-competition space, with the double issue of having severely limited keyword opportunities. Because of this, it didn't make sense to target long-tail and 0-volume keywords as a reliable strategy for building traffic. Since the client already had good trust signals, I decided to surface a list of keywords with potential for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) that would allow the client to surface in AI snippets like Google's Gemini and/or gen-AI engines like Claude and ChatGPT, which would help them bypass the fierce organic search competition. 

The first blog post we produced around this list of keywords targeted "how to analyze a country's economy"; this query showed strong search volume with manageable competition in the AI overviews. I oversaw content production, providing the client with a full topical brief to accelerate their search performance for answering this specific query. To do this, I:

1. Identified this query as informational intent (the type of query most likely to surface a GenAI snippet) with high expertise requirements
2. Recognized that users need step-by-step guidance (rather than just theory) and structured the post to match how people naturally answer the question
3. Analyzed top 10 results for what they covered/missed and found angles competitors weren't addressing (specific methodologies, data points, statistics and data sources)
4. Referenced official sources (World Bank, IMF, government statistics)
5. Cited academic research and economic reports
6. Included data visualizations, charts and case studies
7. Ensured authors were properly credited 

The client was able to use this brief, along with my search intent notes, as a foundation to leverage their expert industry insights, which allowed us to develop authoritative, expert-level content strategy targeting the specific query. 

# Results
## Timeline: 2 weeks (launched June 25, 2024)

Within 2 weeks (June 25): this post:
- Achieved a position 3 organic ranking for target keyword "how to analyze a country's economy"
- Was featured in Google's AI Overview as the primary citation source
- Was cited as a source in ChatGPT as an answer to broad match queries related to the keyword
- Began to generate high-quality, qualified traffic from users seeking economic insights, which led to an uptick in enquiries for the client's consultancy services

 From month 1 to month 3 of publishing we saw a 980% and 890% increase respectively in clicks and impressions, making it the biggest contributor to search traffic on the site outside of the client's service and about pages. 

The fact that this post saw nearly a 10x increase in clicks and almost a 9x increase in impressions after gaining the primary citation in the AI overview demonstrates the significant traffic potential of being featured prominently in AI-powered search results, especially as the top 2 organic results (above the client site's organic ranking) were taken by the World Bank and Investopedia respectively (sites with far, far more domain authority than my client). 

Data from online visibility tools shows that this clientâ€™s page is currently bringing more clicks from this keyword than both of the top 2 results, which lends strength to the AEO theory that small players can, in many cases, find more leverage in the age of generative AI query answering. We are currently accelerating this strategy of direct answer format + expert-level depth + strong authority signals to achieve more AI overview placements for the client. 

### Takeaways

This case study brings a couple of interesting points to light:

1. That the advent of '0-click searches' and gradual disappearance of organic SERP real estate does present new opportunities, and smaller sites who think and execute strategically can capitalize on these opportunities. In this case, <b>being featured in the AI snippet allowed a lower authority site to bypass traditional authority barriers and drive more clicks than the top organic players.</b>
2. How comprehensive AEO optimization combines technical excellence with strategic content development, and thus the continuing importance of technical SEO in the age of AEO/GEO
