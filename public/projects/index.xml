They wanted to capture high-intent search traffic for users seeking guidance on economic evaluation methodologies, and then guide them towards their economic data consultancy offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;strategy&#34;&gt;Strategy&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;phase-1-technical-seo-foundation&#34;&gt;Phase 1: Technical SEO Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before developing new content, I carried out a sweeping technical SEO audit that brought forward a few critical issues that would undermine (and already were undermining) the client&amp;rsquo;s search performance.
