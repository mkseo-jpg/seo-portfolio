<p>An eLearning platform specializing in responsive design courses for web and UX designers was struggling with visibility beyond their branded searches. Their traffic was heavily concentrated on course pages and brand match queries, which had worked well enough so far, but they were missing smart opportunities to capture users through earlier stages of their learning journey, primarily through informational queries that signalled interest or awareness in topics related to the client&rsquo;s courses.</p>
<p>I surfaced an initial list of 24 high-impact queries to base content around. sitting within 3 content &lsquo;silos&rsquo;. Many of these were technical queries where users were searching for explanations of specific responsive design methodologies, which would allow us to create content designed to educate newcomers while positioning advanced courses as next steps.</p>
<p>The silos were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web UX</li>
<li>CSS responsive design queries</li>
<li>Accessibile web design</li>
</ul>
<p>With each content silo mapped to distinct user personas who may be interested in  specific course offerings on the site, I outlined authoritative, detail-rich SEO content for each article, with pillar pages supporting each content silo, and then created logical pathways from educational content to relevant course offerings.</p>
<p>This system served to establish clear content hierarchies that guided users deeper into the learning ecosystem, and also to create authority flow from high-performing content to conversion-focused course pages.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results<a href="#results" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p><b>Timeline</b>: April 2024 - July 2025</p>
<p><b>Traffic Performance</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly Clicks: 2.7K → 7.08K (+162% increase)</li>
<li>Monthly Impressions: 111K → 791K (+613% increase)</li>
<li>Traffic Diversification: Reduced dependency on branded searches from 78% to 34% of total traffic</li>
<li>Course Page Traffic: 45% increase in organic traffic to course landing pages</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Business Impact</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Course enrollment inquiries increased by 89% during the campaign period</li>
<li>Average session duration improved from 1:47 to 3:22 across blog content</li>
<li>Bounce rate decreased from 67% to 41% on educational content pages</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-deindexing-callenge">The Deindexing Callenge<a href="#the-deindexing-callenge" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>In month 6 of the campaign, our highest-performing article (&ldquo;Complete Guide to CSS Grid for Responsive Design&rdquo;) - which was driving approximately 1,200 monthly clicks - was suddenly deindexed from Google. This piece represented nearly 20% of our total organic traffic and was a critical conversion driver.</p>
<p><img src="/images/a11y-single-blog-post-indexing-fix.png" alt="Deindexing"></p>
<p>I launched a comprehensive technical investigation, using Screaming Frog and Google Search Console to identify crawl errors and indexing issues. By analyzing the deindexed page and surrounding content for potential quality or duplication issues, I found three pages with partially overlapping search intent that were creating confusion for search engines: the deindexed piece, an internally competing piece, and third blog post which had a broad overlap with both.</p>
<p>Google couldn&rsquo;t determine which page should rank for related queries, leading to the algorithmic decision to deindex the strongest performer. The &lsquo;content differentiation&rsquo; strategy to recover traffic was as follows:</p>
<p>Page 1: Refocused exclusively on its methodology, only referencing the topic of the competing page through deliberate internal linking to show the relationship between the two topics
Page 2: As above!
Page 3: Was not bringing significant traffic from its target keyword, so this was 301 redirected to page 1</p>
<p>I also updated internal linking across other blog posts to point to the most relevant page for each specific query, modified meta descriptions and title tags to clearly distinguish search intent, adjusted URL structure for better semantic clarity and updated the sitemap with proper priority signals. After submitting all three pages, the original article was restored to the index and regained its previous ranking position within 2 weeks for reindexing through Google Search Console <b>from where it saw a growth in traffic to double the clicks it had before</b>.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways<a href="#takeaways" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>I think this case study demonstrates a couple of crucial principles for scaling content-driven SEO.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Firstly, by mapping content clusters to specific user personas rather than just keyword volumes, we achieved both traffic growth and business relevance. The 162% traffic increase directly translated to 89% more course inquiries because the content attracted the right audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, I think this study also highlights the importance of proper, regular and thorough content auditing; even though the systematic recovery approach to the deindexing of the highest traffic page brought stronger performance, the deindexing could have been avoided in the first place with proactive content auditing (which would have had the same result of boosting traffic).</p>
