Despite being highly qualified and having a range of services already on offer, she was struggling to generate any consultations through her website, which at the time was a static, one-page website that provided basic service information but with limited to no visibility in search results.</p><p>I proposed and executed a comprehensive digital transformation, building a new WordPress site from scratch designed specifically for therapy practice SEO and conversion optimization. The site architecture design was as follows:</p><ul><li>Homepage: Professional overview with clear value proposition and immediate booking CTA</li><li>About Page: Detailed therapist background, credentials and therapeutic approach</li><li>7 Optimized Service Pages: Each targeting high-intent commercial keywords</li><li>Learning & Resources Blog: Educational content hub for SEO and authority building</li><li>Contact & Booking: Streamlined consultation request process through an integrated form plugin</li><li>Privacy & Policies: GDPR-compliant pages building user + crawler trust</li></ul><p>To maximise visibility for the chosen service page keywords, each page included detailed service descriptions with clear benefits, my client&rsquo;s specific approach and methodology, FAQ sections addressing common concerns and trust signals for E-E-A-T (qualifications, experience, testimonials), with multiple conversion opportunities placed throughout the page content.</p><p>On a technical basis, the site build also included:</p><ul><li>Responsive layout optimizing for mobile therapy seekers</li><li>Page speed optimization, with fast loading times crucial for UX and SEO</li><li>Local schema markup + structured data for business information and services</li><li>SSL certificate</li><li>Contact form integration for GDPR-compliant inquiries with automatic follow-ups</li></ul><p>Next, I developed three strategic content clusters for the &lsquo;Learning & Resources&rsquo; section designed to support the service pages while capturing users at different stages of their therapeutic journey. For each cluster, I mapped specific keywords to potential blog posts to make sure each piece served distinct search intents while supporting the overall authority of related service pages.</p><p>This helped to set the foundations for comprehensive topical coverage that would eventually establish the client as a local authority in therapeutic services. To make sure that blog content would rank consistently, I also provided the client with detailed blog outlines and a content calendar for each planned article, incorporating specific ranking factors including:</p><ul><li>Semantic keyword integration throughout headers and body content</li><li>User intent optimization matching search query expectations</li><li>Content depth requirements to outperform competing articles</li><li>Internal linking opportunities to relevant service pages</li><li>E-A-T enhancement strategies including expert citations and credential mentions</li><li>Featured snippet optimization with structured answer formats</li></ul><p><b>These comprehensive outlines enabled the client to produce content that consistently ranked well and continues to drive approximately 80% of qualified traffic to the site.</b></p><h3 id=results---phase-1-strong-search-performance-weak-conversion>Results - Phase 1: Strong Search Performance, Weak Conversion<a href=#results---phase-1-strong-search-performance-weak-conversion class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>Months 1-3 of the strategy implementation saw 4 of 7 service pages ranking on page 1 for target keywords and a significant improvement in local search presence with a position 5 ranking for the main location-based keyword. Blog posts were beginning to rank and drive traffic, which was growing steadily month-over-month across the whole site.</p><p>Despite this initial strong search performance, though, the conversion rate from website visitors to consultation bookings remained low (under 1%). Taking a deeper look revealed that visitors were engaging with content but not taking the next step; essentially, service and blog pages were generating awareness but not compelling action.</p><p>Content was relevant, but potential clients seemed hesitant to commit immediately to full therapy sessions and uncertain about the fit between their needs and my client&rsquo;s approach. Opting for a &rsquo;lower-risk&rsquo; angle, I implemented a &lsquo;Free 10-Minute Discovery Call&rsquo; strategy. Shifting the risk treshold from &ldquo;Get in Touch&rdquo; to &ldquo;Free Discovery Call&rdquo; as the main CTA on all blog and service pages positioned calls as risk-free consultations instead of sales conversation, which gave us a huge leap in conversions over the coming months.</p><h3 id=results---phase-2-conversion-breakthrough>Results - Phase 2: Conversion Breakthrough<a href=#results---phase-2-conversion-breakthrough class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p><img src=/images/therapy-traffic.png alt=Deindexing></p><p>The results from months 3-6 of the strategy are as follows:</p><ul><li>1,500 total site clicks over 3 months (500 clicks/month average)</li><li>Top blog post bringing ~500 clicks (representing 1/3 of total traffic)</li><li>Consistent growth across all 7 optimized service pages</li><li>Position 2 Google Maps ranking for &ldquo;gestalt therapy london&rdquo;</li><li>Conversion rate jumped to 3-4% from website visitors to discovery call bookings</li><li>15-20 discovery calls booked per month (from previous 2-3 inquiries)</li><li>Full calendar, 2-month waiting list established</li></ul><h3 id=takeaways>Takeaways<a href=#takeaways class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>I think this case study demonstrates several critical success factors for service-based local businesses who want to engage with SEO as a driver of inquiries:</p><ol><li><p>The complete site rebuild initially drew some opposition from the client, who was happy with the aesthetics of their existing static website. I managed to rebuild the site almost identically in WordPress, but with the technical and structural foundation necessary for effective SEO and conversion optimization. Without the proper site architecture being in place, even the best SEO efforts would have failed to generate business results.</p></li><li><p>The dramatic improvement from &lt;1% to 3-4% conversion rate shows how CRO can multiply SEO investment returns. The same blog posts that were previously generating 2-3 monthly inquiries began producing 15-20 qualified prospects simply through better conversion pathway design; even though traffic increased, it didn&rsquo;t increase 6-fold (unlike inquiries).</p></li><li><p>In service-based industries, local search dominance can be more valuable than national keyword rankings. Achieving top 3 Maps pack positions for therapy-related searches in London created a sustainable competitive moat that drove consistent, high-intent traffic.</p></li></ol><h3 id=case-studies>Case Studies<a href=#case-studies class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><ul><li><a href=/projects/aeo/>AEO Keyword Win</a></li><li><a href=/projects/elearning/>eLearning Keyword Clustering</a></li><li><a href=/projects/therapy/>Therapy Client Site Build + SEO + CRO</a></li></ul></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2025</span></div></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.js></script></div></body></html>
